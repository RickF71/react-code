            <p>This is my main React page.  
                I decided to utilize Bootstrap because it's amazing how it works.
                I also wanted a way to separate my training assignments into different
                areas rather than overwriting my old stuff.  I like to keep a record of
                what I have done before.
            </p>
        </div>
    );
}

export default Home;
